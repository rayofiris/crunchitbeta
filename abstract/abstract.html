            <div class="body">This is a beta version of crunch it!, a game-esque interactive website set in a world where time is inconsiderate and the work of the player goes nowhere. At this stage of development, I seek to inquire on how my love for annoying games and desire to make one myself can serve as the basis for the world of crunch it!, a world built upon a set of convoluted control systems and ideas that brandishes a veil of condescending simplicity.</div>

        <div class="dialogue2"> 
            <div class="header2"><button class="button2" onclick="hideTwo()">x &nbsp;</button></div>
            <div class="body2"> Since I'm still a bit shy about revealing the full scope of everything I want to cover in the final product, most of the content here will primarily be focused on the functional aspects of crunch it!'s gameplay. Just know that several aspects of crunch it! will take inspiration from the arts and design sphere that I currently exist in, hopefully coming at it with an angle that is both satirical/lighthearted and meaningful.  </div>

        <div class="dialogue3"> 
            <div class="header3"><button class="button3" onclick="hideThree()">x &nbsp;</button></div>
            <div class="body3"> Plus, this isn't even crunch it! yet! It's crunch it! beta, a preliminary, not fully realized state of a game that hasn't officially come out yet. I'm essentially just testing things out here as it has been done in many other beta versions of video games. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait a few more months for the picture to fully develop in front of your eyes. Time is inconsiderate, and so am I.  </div>

       <div class="dialogue4"> 
            <div class="header4"><button class="button4" onclick="hideFour()">x &nbsp;</button></div>
            <div class="body4">Also (disclaimer), you will probably see me refer to crunch it! as a game rather than a "game-esque interactive website" for a majority of this essay. Ignore that, or at least don't care about it too much. For one, it's less words to type over and over again, so I'm shortening it for brevity's sake, but I am additionally choosing to live vicariously through my word choice as a struggling game developer for the sake of art, or something (Doesn't that sound annoying?). </div>
