         <div class="text1">(1) Similarly to the state of the game itself, my playthrough of LittleBigPlanet 3 was a crunched one. LittleBigPlanet 3’s release was unfortunately plagued by a rushed development process, its final product being in “a notoriously glitchy state” with “a significant amount of content… cut from the final release [4].”</div>
         <div class="text2">(2) When it comes to games like these (or other types of projects that end up worse than they should’ve been), I often like to think about what kind of state the developers/creators were in both while they were making it and during the time after the game’s release. To what degree did they mourn the many assets and unfinished projects lost to a lack of time? What pieces from the game do they still keep with them? </div>
         <div class="text3">(3) How often do they think about it, and are they embarrassed over it all? Do they tell themselves that they could have done better? Did an echoing voice reverberate throughout their minds: “Crunch it! Why can’t you just crunch it? You should be able to crunch it.” I ask these questions because I know that whenever I present a project that was both rushed and hacked together and looks like it was rushed and hacked together, I feel embarrassed too. </div>
         <div class="text4">(4) In a similar vein to games that are conceptually interesting but functionally frustrating, works centered around an interesting concept that ultimately fell victim to creative burnout touch my heart as well. Spending a lot of time on something that ultimately goes to shit just sucks, plain and simple. </div>
         <div class="text5">(5) Thinking about LittleBigPlanet 3 always makes me think of Majora’s Mask as well, for despite its similar issue of a tight deadline, the development of Majora’s Mask is regarded to have been much more successful within the time constraints. “Since Majora’s Mask had a developmental time limit of a year, assets were borrowed from Ocarina of Time [5]”, the game’s predecessor. “If you think of the development process in terms of makeup, [they]’d already laid down the foundation,” and “[a]ll [they] had to do was layer everything else on top [2].”</div>
         <div class="text6">(6) While many of the basic functions for this game simply came from the older one, a portion of the content that was cut from LittleBigPlanet 3 on the other hand (aside from the many unused assets) involved creating completely new systems such as switching between a 2d and 3d platformer. The idea of this sounded really cool to me when I first learned of it, but I can imagine that it was also probably too intimidating of a task for it to be implemented thoroughly.</div>
         <div class="text7">(7) Unfortunately, the developers seem to have been focused on creating more new functions, new graphics, new worlds, and more new things in general than they had time for. Majora’s Mask took on a more contained, narrative-focused approach. Similarly to Pikmin 1, the game also operated under a time-based mechanic, specifically a repeating cycle of three days.</div>
         <div class="text8">(8) “With Majora’s Mask, players retread the same events over and over again in order to save the world from destruction… “[involving] mastery and deep understanding of its contents [5].” Replaying the three day cycles as new items were gathered and more dungeons were cleared were primarily how the player would come to understand the story more complexly, as most of the lore was “discovered by completing optional side-quests [5].”</div>
         <div class="text9">(9) “It’s useless to make something that the audience just skims over in one viewing, like a movie. The full flavor of a creation gradually emerges with each viewing, as all the subtleties reveal themselves [2].” Creating smaller scale settings allowed for a greater amount of details to be added, favoring quality over quantity without trying to do both.</div>
         <div class="text10">(10) When remembering my playthrough of LittleBigPlanet 3, I feel less annoyed regarding the game itself (unless you count the super long loading screens) and more so regarding the circumstances surrounding it. It serves as a reminder of the fact that I unfortunately cannot force myself to do way too much like I usually do. To put it simply, I want to make a game that’s finished on time and doesn’t suck. </div>
