            <div class="text">My experience playing Pikmin 1 was quite a stressful one. To preface, “[i]n an interesting design choice, that … would later [be] describe[d] as "a little bit too strict and confining", the player was given just 30 days to complete their task of recovering ship parts to return Captain Olimar to his home planet [10].” Much like how my projects frequently start off, I thought “okay, this is doable, I should be able to progress through this quite smoothly” and proceeded to spend the remainder of my playthrough being proven incredibly wrong. Not only did each of the day cycles move faster than I was prepared for, but the little amounts of precious time that I had left were constantly stolen from me by the bombardment of things that would go wrong (my pikmin really loved to die for no reason). 
<br>
As once stated by Sheik from Ocarina of Time, “The flow of time is always cruel… Its speed seems different for each person, but no one can change it [7]…” Aside from the fact that this is a banger quote that I immediately knew I had to include somehow when I was rewatching a playthrough of this game, I also found it quite ironic and a little funny that they were saying this in a setting where one’s control over time works a little differently. Obviously, a player’s control over time is not complete (especially in time-based games) since the allotted cycles of time you have to complete a game’s tasks are coded in and integral to its structure, but within a game, time still becomes a more malleable force. Its presence is constant, yet its shape and progression can be molded to suit one’s needs to varying degrees. For example, in Pikmin 1, while the threat of running out of time before bringing back all of the ship parts I wanted to on a given day was always an intimidating pressure, if my trip did not end up as efficient as I was planning, there was always the option for me to restart the day or restart from my previous save. The simple option to rewind and try again breaks the way that time works in real life (I would kill for a rewind button I could use on the time I spend on Javascript), for time here is always moving and dragging you along with it. “Digital games are a temporal medium—where players drive the gameplay forward to completion while the game narrative unfolds over time [9].” Rather than driving time myself, I often feel like time drives me and pulls me in all sorts of directions. However, within a game (including the annoying ones), I have more agency to tug on time and lead it a few steps towards somewhere that matches my preferences. In the case of crunch it!, I want to reduce the opportunities for control as much as possible and make the time within the game a more unchangeable, overwhelming force.
