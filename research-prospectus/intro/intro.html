            <div class="body"> When Skyward Sword first came out on the Wii, I remember it getting a lot of shit. Players’ most scathing criticisms of the game often came from their hatred of its motion control implementation, but other negative aspects of the game were also pointed out frequently. Examples of this include the rather insistent companion that would constantly interrupt your gameplay to point out extremely obvious things, repetitive questlines/areas, and a really mixed bag of boss fights. The original Skyward Sword was popularly considered one of the worst entries in the Legend of Zelda series for years after its release, but for me, it was, and probably still is, one of my favorite games of all time.  </div>

            <div class="body2">Why did I like it so much? Many of its qualities pointed towards it being just another annoying game, but Skyward Sword ended up becoming the first of many annoying games that would shove its way into my heart. My favorite kinds of games are ones that I like to call “conceptually interesting but functionally frustrating”, and I find the things that limit them and make them annoying to be equally as compelling and charming as the things that they do successfully. While my interest in video games has unwaveringly continued throughout my life (or if anything, gotten more intense lately as I’ve gradually woven my inspirations into more of my design work), I actually have not played that many games recently as said design work has currently taken up a majority of my time. </div>

            <div class="body3">My relationship with work has consistently been a frustrating and codependent one, and I am more often than not unable to create space for a life outside of it aside from the annoying games that I occasionally play. Given that I currently exist at a point where my value primarily comes from the things that I produce and the tasks that I do, it’s both fitting and ironic that my greatest escape would come from something where I continuously create for myself a sense of competence over completed tasks. The reaches of my brain often feel trapped and encircled by a layer of thick walls, the foundation of which being built around this vague, all-encompassing idea of “work” and thoughts of the work that I could be doing at all times. The idea to create crunch it! honestly came from a lack of ideas that I had in the first place. If I have no time to think about anything else but the little time I have, why not make something about that?  </div>

        <div class="dialogue4"> 
            <div class="header4"><button class="button4" onclick="hideFour()">x &nbsp;</button></div>
            <div class="body4">Despite how the blocks of time required to dedicate to this would only require me to crunch it further, I knew that I wanted to actually play some games for once, these games being Psychonauts, Pikmin 1, and LittleBigPlanet 3. The three came to me by recommendation of my roommate, who when learning of my interest in annoying games, enthusiastically pointed to them as ones for which I should drop everything and play immediately. Each game was also conveniently centered around a piece of game development that I was interested in, so I used my overall playthrough experiences as a basis for the research that I did for crunch it!’s conceptualization. Through playing these games, I wanted to explore how various aspects such as disjointed controls and gameplay, time-based mechanics, and rushed development processes contribute to the atmosphere, narrative, and overall experience of video games. Why am I so fascinated by something that ends up being so functionally frustrating? How can I use this fascination as a vehicle to drive crunch it! forward? How can I make a game that’s so shitty and so annoying that it’s actually kind of beautiful? To put it simply, I want to recreate a feeling: a feeling of stillness that can never be grasped, a to-do list whose boxes can never be fully checked, and a cycle of time that can never be controlled.  </div>
