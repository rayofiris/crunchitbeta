            <div class="body">I often wish that I could just crumple the concept of time into a ball and set it aside, only unfolding it and letting it be when I feel like it, but unfortunately, I do not have any choice in this matter. I must bite into this project and attack it head on, careful not to leave a trail of crumbs behind me. I must crunch it by any means necessary. That being said, if crunching it does not guarantee good results, how can I, a person with around three to five months to spare, crunch it effectively? What do I want to create within that chunk of time? How can I make it as annoying as possible?  </div>

            <div class="header2"><button class="button2" onclick="hideTwo()">x &nbsp;</button></div>
            <div class="body2">Throughout the whole of crunch it!, the player’s actions should be driven by a control scheme that doesn’t make any sense whatsoever, constantly running into walls over details/parts of the gameplay that are oddly specific and wouldn’t reasonably be known by them. In other words, “...the skills needed to work the controller don't map to what's needed to excel at the game [11].” However, a sort of omniscient presence within the game should expect the player to automatically know how to complete a task at any given time despite intentionally not providing a manual or tutorial of any sorts. Echoing sentiments of "you should know how to be able to do this" (without explicitly saying something so cheesy) and toying with the consistency of validation that games often provide might assist in increasing player frustration and cause them to constantly question their own measure of skills in the game.  </div>
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue3"> 
            <div class="header3"><button class="button3" onclick="hideThree()">x &nbsp;</button></div>
            <div class="body3">“The novel experience of controlling the narrative you are inside of “[feels] more seductive in digital media—where… the choices [feel] more constant [1],” but in crunch it!, the player will also hopefully feel less of the moderate control that they usually feel in standard games over the passage of time. I want to create an atmosphere where moments of stillness are few and far between, yet the silence of them feels just as wrong and overwhelming as the overlapping and simultaneous cycles of tasks that they are required to complete. When it comes to my own cycles of tasks, I need to keep in mind that it’s easier to crunch it if the world is more contained.  I should focus on creating something that is more narratively solid and replayable over something overly expansive, or if anything, remember just how long debugging always takes. Though time will always be inconsiderate, I should make sure that my work actually goes somewhere this time.  </div>
